# SnowShader
A snow accumulation shader I made using DX11 Tessellation and DX11 Displacement inside Shader Forge.

Current setting has the snow gather on Particle Collision Enter.
There is a Game Manager object which can be turned on to allow overtime accululation, you will need to disable the particle to look at this.
